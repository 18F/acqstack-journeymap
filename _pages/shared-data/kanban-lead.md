title: Kanban Lead
---

TTS Office of Acquisitions (Acqstack) is divided up into several "substacks." A substack is a medium sized (usually 8-10 people), cross-functional team that takes on projects. 

A Kanban lead is a representative from that group (not necessarily someone "in charge" of the group though) who meets with the Acqstack Deputy Director and other Kanban leads regularly to discuss upcoming substack capacity and upcoming projects.

The Current Kanban Leads are: Jessie Posilkin, Kirsten Green, and Michael Torres.
