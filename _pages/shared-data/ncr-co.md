title: NCR Contracting Officer
---

NCR (National Capital Region) provides several contracting officers (CO's) to TTS. While TTS has our own COs, some of whom are warranted, currently TTS COs serve more as consulting COs on procurements. A CO from NCR is the official CO for all procurements with external clients. 

TTS was recently given limited internal procurement authority, which lets a TTS CO be the official CO for a small number of procurements with internal (within TTS) clients. 

Current NCR CO's are: Fred Thomas, Dan Higgins, Al Munoz. Potentially Aleseia Saunders
