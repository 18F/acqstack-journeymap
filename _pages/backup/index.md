Hello, friend! So I heard you want to buy something. That’s great. Just whip out that credit card and - what’s that? You work for the federal government? Oh, okay then. No, it’s no problem. It’s just a little more complicated than buying socks or amazon web services would be in the private sector.

To help you through, Acqstack has produced a journey map to guide you on your acquisitions path. So grab your towel and stick out your thumb, my friend. It’s time for us to begin our grand journey.

Oh, before we begin. One quick question: are you buying something for someone in TTS (OPP/OCSIT, 18F, etc), or are you buying something for a non-TTS client (anywhere else in GSA, IRS, Department of State, etc)?
