title: Internal Client Intake
---
### What happens in this stage? 
Someone else in TTS says "We have something we need to buy!" Unlike external buys where Acqstack can decide the client or project is not a good fit and choose to pass on the work, we must be involved in all buys TTS performs.

Someone tells the [Director of TTS Acquisitions]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/tts-acq-director/) or [Deputy Director of TTS Acquisitions]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/tts-acq-dep-director/) they need something in person, over email, or slack in a DM, in #acquisition, or somewhere else. There is no standard place or way to request assistance at this time. #acq-wg-inception is working on improving this.

Things can come up in a number of ways: 

- Surprise fires, such as a contract expired without those using it realizing it was going to.
- Parties outside of our control (for example, OGC) decide a contract cannot continue, or options cannot be used, and a new contract must be put in place.
- Pre-planned, well thought out requirements from a program office.
- One contract is ending, but there is money left.

Because we are required to assist in all internal TTS buys, there has been a reoccuring issue of how involved we get in answering the question "Is this the right thing to buy, and is the client ready to buy this?" 

In some ways, we have less control than with external clients. That help is obstensibly why they hired us, and if the external client is committed to doing something we think is harmful, we have the ability to walk away. But in other ways, we have more control with internal clients. Ideally, we have more awareness about what our fellow TTS program offices are working on, and have more ability to get involved earlier in the procurement strategy and requirements definition process.

### How long does this process usually take?
Unknown.

### Who is involved in this stage??

- [Director of TTS Acquisitions]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/tts-acq-director/) or [Deputy Director of TTS Acquisitions]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/tts-acq-dep-director/)
- Sometimes TTS Agency Partnerships
- Other TTS program office (the client)

### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage? 
1. Tasks done
  * Established client point of contact
  * Verbal confirmation budget for TTS and for vendor is available
  * A card is created in the Kanban board, links to the [Executive Summary]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/executive-summary/), and is moved to "Staging."
2. Documents created
  * [Executive Summary]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/executive-summary/) document is filled out.
  * Generate an [IA Part A]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ia-part-a/) and [IA Part B]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ia-part-b/) for this client from the template. Does not need to be filled out right now to proceed.
  * New google drive folder is created in [WHERE SHOULD THIS FOLDER BE?]
3. Approvals needed
  * [Director of TTS Acquisitions]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/tts-acq-director/) or [Deputy Director of TTS Acquisitions]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/tts-acq-dep-director/)

### What can go wrong in this stage? 
In the past, there has been an expectation that no, or very little, planning or coordination is necessary. Just "here's an email, now lets go go go!"

### What is the next step?
The project is staffed!
