title: Infrastructure Review
---

If you are buying software, pay attention to this stage! If you're buying access to people, you can proceed to the Drafting stage. 

There is a preliminary review, and a full GSA IT review.

### How long does this process usually take?
Potentially months, but you can proceed once the preliminary review is done, which should take less than a week.

### What happens in this stage? 
[Get more details about the Infrastructure Review process here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AUyRggdKWLRcHC3E4ssHE_2tmOaDYTv0ex0lgwbwFSA/edit) A summary is below:

If you know what you want to buy: 

1. Is anyone else using this software, or something similar to it? Ping your Infrastructure Lead to find out.
2. Check the pre-approved software list [LINK]. If the software is on that list, no review or approvals necessary. 
3. If it's not on that list, send your request to the Infrastructure Lead for that business unit or department for review. You may not proceed until this initial review is complete.
4. Once Infrastructure approves, be sure you get added to the official GSA IT review process (this includes a Legal and 508 compliance review).
5. [GET FEEDBACK ON THIS SECTION] You may continue with the procurement while GSA IT review happens. You can potentially apply for pilot status here, through a p-card.

If you don't know what you want to buy: 

1. In the case of a full and open competition where you're unsure at this phase who will even bid, let alone win, Infrastructure review cannot feasible happen here. 
2. It must happen immediately after award, and be sure to include language that awards the contract to the winner pending successful GSA IT review.
