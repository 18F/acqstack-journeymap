title: Solicitation Drafting
---

### How long does this process usually take?
A few days to a week or two to create the documents. A few weeks to a few months depending on client reviews.

### What happens in this stage? 
This is where the magic happens: drafting of the solicitation documents! Typically the TTS CO will take point on writing these, but they'll be aided by the tech lead and the product lead. 

The program office should be involved in reviewing these documents as they're written. This will reduce review times later on and makes sure they're on board with the direction we're heading.

We typically write these documents in Google Docs to facilitate easy collaboration and sharing.

These are the documents that must be created before we can move forward to the next stage, assigning a Contracting Officer from NCR:
	- [Executive Summary]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/executive-summary)
	- [Performance Work Statement (PWS)]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/pws)
	- [Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE)]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/igce)
	- [Market Research]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/market-research)
	- [Evaluation Criteria]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/eval-criteria)

These are the documents that must be created, but can be created after we have an assigned CO from NCR:
	- [Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/qasp)
	- [Acquisition Plan]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/acquisition-plan)
	- [Any justifications that are needed]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/justifications)
	- [Proposal Template]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/proposal-template)
	- [The RF(x) itself]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/rfx)

While the CO is writing solicitation documents, the PM has a few things to take care of before you can move forward. 

1. The [IX]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ix) also needs to be completed by the TTS Finance team before we can move forward. The PM usually takes care of getting this done.
2. Make sure the [IA]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ia) [Part A]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ia-part-a and [Part B]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ia-part-b) between TTS and NCR is done and signed.
