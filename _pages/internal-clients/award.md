### What happens in this stage? 
If the final price is more than the previous IX, the [IX]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/IX) must be rewritten and updated with the final price. The [IGCE]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/IGCE) must also be updated to match the final price. If these need to be updated, resubmit the updated documents to NCR together. Will need to get the IX re-approved by everyone in the approval chain.

NCR will make the award to the vendor.

Any unsuccessful vendors may request a debrief from NCR/TTS/the client.

Plan kickoff meeting with vendor to go over contract details, expectations, and next steps. Clarify with [NCR CO]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ncr-co) what they want their role in setting up and conducting this meeting to be. 

Conduct any necessary external communications about the award (blog posts, tweets, announcements, etc). You may need to involve the Office of Strategic Communications (OSC) (previously Office of Communications and Marketing (OCM)). Talk to #outreach if you need to get in touch with them.

Check in on/reinitiate GSA IT/infrastructure reviews. Get pilot status if necessary and haven't already gotten it. If a GSA IT review is necessary but not yet complete, there must be language in the award that says the award is contingent on GSA IT approval.

### How long does this process usually take?
A few days to a week, assuming all financial documents (ie: the IX) were already submitted and correct.

### Who is involved in this stage? 
- [NCR CO]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ncr-co)
