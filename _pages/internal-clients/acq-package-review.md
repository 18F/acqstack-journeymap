title: Acquisition Package Review
---

### What happens in this stage? 
The [NCR CO]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ncr-co/) and [NCR CS]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ncr-cs/) review the solicitation documents the TTS project team put together. They may ask for changes, additional explanations, additional documents, or for certain sections to be rewritten. Everyone should be using Google Docs to review and make edits.

After changes are made, go back and get the client's approval. Then go back and get NCR's approval. 

This approval process is a cycle. Keep going until everyone is happy.

This process will take way longer than you expect it to, even for short and simple procurements. 

### How long does this process usually take?
3-5 weeks. Sometimes longer.

### Who is involved in this stage? 
- [NCR CO]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ncr-co/)
- [NCR CS]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ncr-cs/)
- TTS Project Team
- Client project team
- Many approvers

### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage? 
1. Tasks done
	- All approvers must sign off on the final version of the documents.
	- NCR and TTS mutually agree documents are "locked" and no more edits will be made by either party.
2. Documents created
	- N/A
3. Approvals needed
	- [NCR CO]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ncr-co/)
	- [NCR CS]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ncr-cs/)
	- TTS Project Team
	- Client project team
	- TTS front office (?)
	- TTS Commissioner (?)
	- [TTS Assistant Commissioner]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/tts-assistant-commissioner/) for that program office
	- [TTS OGC]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/tts-ogc/)
	- [NCR OGC]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ncr-ogc/)
	- [NCR Commissioner]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ncr-commissioner/)

### What can go wrong in this stage? 
There is a whole lot of going in circles getting approvals at this stage. Often, people farther from the project work (such as OGC) won't be properly read in on why we're taking a certain approach or doing things differently than the standard way. Be prepared for speedbumps, unexpected requests, or changes that don't seem to make sense given the acquisition strategy you've put together. 

### What is the next step?
Release the RFP.
