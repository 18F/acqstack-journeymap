title: Solicitation Scoping
---

### How long does this process usually take?
Weeks to months.

### What happens in this stage? 
It's time to figure out what the client needs to buy, and the acquisition strategy to get it! Here, we may run workshops, do user research, and even do some prototyping. 

We learn as much as we can to develop an acquisition strategy and prepare to draft the acquisition documents.

Because this is an internal buy, the activities in this phase may vary depending on whether we're helping them scope the acquisition, or just executing on it. 

There are three types of things we can help our clients buy:

1. Dev work to build them a thing
2. "Off the shelf software" (COTS)
3. Body shop/staff augmentation

### Who is involved in this stage? 

- The client team
- The Acqstack team

### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage? 
1. Tasks done
	- Workshops or conversations to scope the need
2. Documents created
	- Notes about solicitationÂ needs
3. Approvals needed
	- Preliminary client buy-off on acquisition strategy

### What can go wrong in this stage? 
Sometimes there is a desire to "just get started" and we just have a conversation with the client instead of a larger workshop. This is risky, and depending on the buy can definitely come back to bite you.

### What is the next step?
Infrastructure review
