title: Intake
---

### How long does this process usually take?

Usually 2-8 weeks. The length of the Intake phase depends on how well-scoped the project is and whether there is familiarity with the Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) process from the agency POC.

### What happens in this stage?

The largest part of this is defining and scoping the engagement and getting agreement from all parties. This should include alignment on the rough labor breakdown between TTS and the vendor.

The partner agency point of contact completes the [IAA prep form](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcP-ifAEPjk1FUK4q_hzkSmlAJaIyGx9y_4BSLrJI_ZLdVzw/viewform) and provides all information for the IAA to TTS. Ensure the funding official, product owner, and other stakeholders at the agency approve the cost and understands they are paying for TTS labor and vendor labor. 

### Who is involved in this stage?

- TTS management
- Possibly a TTS Product Manager
- Client Product Owner
- Client senior agency stakeholders

### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage? 

1. Tasks done
	- Partner agency completes [IAA prep form](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcP-ifAEPjk1FUK4q_hzkSmlAJaIyGx9y_4BSLrJI_ZLdVzw/viewform) and TTS ensures we have everything needed for IAA creation.
2. Documents created
	- Scope engagement and write relevant scoping sections of IA Part A and B.
3. Approvals
	- All major stakeholders need to understand and approve the project scope and the breakdown of funding between TTS and the vendor. No official or signed approval is needed at this step though.

### What can go wrong in this stage? 

Lack of definition and alignment around how funding will be apportioned between TTS and the vendor could present problems later on. It is critical for the agency partner and TTS representatives to be closely involved and align all stakeholders around project scope, funding, and “ownership.”

### What is the next step?

When the project is well-defined and approved, the project moves into the Agreements phase.
