title: Intake
---

### What happens in this stage?

This stage is where you define and scope the engagement, and get agreement from the TTS project team and the client. This includes estimates for the cost of TTS Acquisition's services, in addition to the cost of the vendor. Ensure you have agreement from the client on the rough labor breakdown between TTS and the vendor.

### How long does this process usually take?

Usually 2-8 weeks. The length of the Intake phase depends on how well-scoped the project is and whether there is familiarity with the Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) process from the agency POC.

### Who is involved in this stage?

- TTS management
- Possibly a Acqstack PM
- Client Product Owner
- Client senior agency stakeholders

### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage? 

1. Tasks done
	- Estimated total project cost
	-	Defining scope
2. Documents created
	- Scope engagement and write relevant scoping sections of IA Part A and B.
3. Approvals
	- All major stakeholders need to understand and agree on the project scope and the breakdown of funding between TTS and the vendor. No official or signed approval is needed at this step though.

### What can go wrong in this stage? 

Lack of definition and understanding around how funding will be apportioned between TTS and the vendor could present problems later on. It is critical for the agency partner and TTS representatives to be closely involved and align all stakeholders around project scope, funding, and ownership.

### What is the next step?

When the project is well-defined and all stakeholders are in agreement, the project moves into the Agreements phase. Create card in Kanban board.
