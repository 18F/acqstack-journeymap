title: Intake
---

### How long does this process usually take?

The length of the Intake phase depends on how well-scoped the project is and whether there is familiarity with the Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) process from the agency POC. The process will usually take 1-2 weeks.

### What happens in this stage?

The largest part of this is defining the engagement, writing the SOW, and getting agreement from all parties. This should include alignment on the rough labor breakdown between TTS and the vendor.

The partner agency point of contact completes the IAA prep form, provides all information for the IAA to TTS, and verifies funding availability for both TTS labor and vendor labor prior to moving into the next phase.

### Who is involved in this stage?

TTS management and possibly a TTS Product Manager, working with the agency partner Product Owner and senior agency stakeholders who need to approve the scope of the engagement.


### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage? 

1. Prepare info for IAA - Partner agency completes agreements form and TTS ensures we have everything needed for IAA creation.
2. Scope engagement and write SOW
3. Approvals - All major stakeholders need to understand and approve the project scope and the breakdown of funding between TTS and the vendor.

### What can go wrong in this stage? 

Lack of definition and alignment around how funding will be apportioned between TTS and the vendor could present problems later on. It is critical for the agency partner and TTS representatives to be closely involved and align all stakeholders around project scope, funding, and “ownership.”

### What is the next step?

When the project is well-defined and SOW approved, the project moves into the Agreements phase.
