### What happens in this stage? 
If the final price is more than the previous IX: IX must be rewritten and updated with the final price, IGCE needs to be updated with final price.  Submit these to NCR together.

NCR makes the award. Notify the Director and Deputy Director of Acquisitions the award has been made by email. 

NCR designates a COR (who can, and in almost every case, should be a member of Acqstack). For Agile BPA, they must be a Level 2 COR or higher. Once TTS decides who the COR should be, we send the COR 2 Certification Letter to NCR. NCR will verify it, then issue a COR Designee letter to that person. Designate an alternate COR (aCOR).

Update Github Pages site with the relevant information: pages.18f.gov/ads-bpa.

Once all that is done, you can schedule the kickoff with the vendor, the client, and NCR. NCR has a 15 minute-or-so agenda they will go through, then turn it over to you and the client.

Perform any necessary external communications about this award and debrief unsuccessful vendors.
