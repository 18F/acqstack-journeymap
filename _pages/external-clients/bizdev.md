### How long does this process usually take?

The length of time in Biz Dev is highly variable depending on the urgency of the agency’s needs and how familiar the agency is with how TTS works.

### What happens in this stage?

Biz Dev happens in three primary ways:

1. Repeat business with an agency who has been a TTS partner before
2. Inbound request from a referral or from hearing about TTS’s track record
3. TTS staff making outbound inquiries for important projects we can help execute

TTS evaluates each potential project based on whether an acquisition is the right thing for the agency to do at the time, especially compared to alternatives (for example, building a small prototype instead to validate initial assumptions). TTS and the agency mutually agree to move forward and work together on an assisted acquisition.

### Who is involved in this stage?

One or two members of TTS Acquisitions, the agency sponsor for the potential project, and Agency Partnerships.

### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage?

1. Tasks done
	- Ensure funding availability: Is there enough money available to execute a TTS assisted acquisition? When does the funding expire (1 year money vs multi-year money)?
	- Acqstack and an agency agree to move forward and work together on an assisted acquisition.
	- Agency readiness: Has the partner agency identified an empowered Product Owner? Does the project have senior stakeholder buy-in? Does the agency understand the agile process and are they willing to execute the project using open source code? If modular procurement is appropriate, are they willing to execute the procurements that way?
2. Documents created
	- N/A
3. Approvals 
	- TTS Acquisitions management
	- Agency management

### What can go wrong in this stage?

This stage is intended to be exploratory, and very low-risk for all parties. No funding has been obligated and TTS and the potential partner agency are trying to establish fit. As a reminder, no work is done before a signed agreement is in place.

### What is the next step?

Intake.
