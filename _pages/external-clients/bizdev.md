### How long does this process usually take?

The length of time in Biz Dev is highly variable depending on the urgency of the agency’s needs and how familiar the agency is with how TTS works.

### What happens in this stage?

Biz Dev happens in three primary ways:
Repeat business with an agency who has been a TTS partner before
Inbound request from a referral or from hearing about TTS’s track record
TTS staff making outbound inquiries for important projects we can help execute

TTS evaluates each potential project based on whether an acquisition is the right thing for the agency to do at the time, especially compared to alternatives (for example, building a small prototype instead to validate initial assumptions).

### Who is involved in this stage?

One or two members of TTS Acquisitions and the agency sponsor for the potential project.

### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage?

1. Ensure funding availability - Is there enough money available to execute a TTS assisted acquisition? When does the funding expire (1 year money vs multi-year money)?

2. Agency readiness - Has the partner agency identified an empowered Product Owner? Does the project have senior stakeholder buy-in? Do the agency understand the Agile process and are they willing to execute the project using open source code?

3. Approvals - Approval from TTS Acquisitions management and agency management in order to move into project scoping and IAA creation.

### What can go wrong in this stage?

This stage is intended to be exploratory, and very low-risk for all parties. No funding has been obligated and TTS and the potential partner agency are trying to establish fit.

### What is the next step?

If the project is given a green light from TTS and from the agency, we move to Intake.
