title: Release RFP
---

### What happens in this stage? 
NCR gives us the final package to review. Once we approve it, they will put it out on eBuy within a few hours. 

TTS creates a Github repository for this buy. Include a Contributing and License file, a Readme with the RFQ number, dates when questions are due, when final bids are due, and any other necessary information for vendors. Also create a Issues template for vendors to use when posting questions. Post the solicitation documents in a folder on that repository. You can use the [Forest Service e-Permitting API repo](https://github.com/18F/bpa-fs-epermit-api) as a template.

### How long does this process usually take?
A few hours to a day or two.
