### How long does this process usually take?

The amount of time spent in the Agreements process depends largely on the speed with which TTS and the agency partner can usher the Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) through the necessary approvals. This process usually takes 30-60 days, but is highly variable depending on how long it takes to obtain signature and finalize the engagement.

### What happens in this stage?
The TTS IAA process is used to formalize a tripartite agreement between TTS, National Capital Region (NCR) Contracting Office, and an agency partner where TTS/NCR will perform an assisted acquisition on behalf of the agency partner.

### Who is involved in this stage?

TTS - Acquisitions Team, Agreements Team, Finance Team
NCR - OGC/Legal, Project Manager
Partner agency - Legal, Project Team

### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage? 
1. Finalize IAA - This includes SOW, 7600A and 7600B (or different forms as required by other agencies)
2. IAA Signatures
-TTS Approving Authority (Rob Cook)
-NCR Approving Authority (Darrick Early)
-TTS OCFO
-FAS/NCR OCFO
-Client POC
-Client finance POC

### What can go wrong in this stage? 

This process can take an enormous amount of time if there is not a good process and working relationship between the project team, legal, finance, and the approving authorities at TTS, NCR, and the agency.

### What is the next step?

Once the IAA is signed, we move into the Solicitation Scoping phase.
