### How long does this process usually take?
As of December 2016, the average time is 42 days. The amount of time spent in the Agreements process depends largely on how fast TTS and the agency partner get the necessary approvals. This process usually takes between 30-60 days, but is highly variable depending on how long it takes to obtain signature and finalize the engagement. 

### What happens in this stage?
The TTS IAA process is used to formalize a tripartite agreement between TTS, National Capital Region (NCR) Contracting Office, and an agency partner where TTS/NCR will perform an assisted acquisition on behalf of the agency partner.

### Who is involved in this stage?

- TTS: Acquisitions Team, Agreements Team, Finance Team
- NCR: OGC/Legal, Project Manager
- Partner agency: Legal, Project Team

### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage? 
1. Tasks done
	- Finalize IAA
2. Documents created
	- SOW
	- 7600A
	- 7600B 
	- Different forms as required by other agencies
3. Approvals needed
	- TTS Commissioner
	- NCR Deputy Commissioner
	- TTS OCFO
	- FAS/NCR OCFO
	- Client point of contact
	- Client Finance point of contact

### What can go wrong in this stage? 

This process can take an enormous amount of time if there is not a good process and working relationship between the project team, legal, finance, and the approving authorities at TTS, NCR, and the agency.

### What is the next step?

When IAA goes out for client signature, Acqstack Management creates a card for the project on the Acqstack Kanban Board under "IAA pending".

Once the IAA is signed, move into the Staffing phase.
