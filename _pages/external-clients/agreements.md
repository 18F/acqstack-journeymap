### How long does this process usually take?
As of December 2016, the average time from IAA Request Form being filled out to final signature is 42 days, and typically ranges from 30 to 60 days. The amount of time spent in the Agreements process depends largely on how fast TTS and the agency partner get the necessary approvals and signatures and finalize the agreement. 

### What happens in this stage?
The TTS IAA process is used to formalize a tripartite agreement between TTS, National Capital Region (NCR) Contracting Office, and an agency partner where TTS/NCR will perform an assisted acquisition on behalf of the agency partner.

The TTS Agreements team will manage the workflow of shipping all documents to all the right approvers - please do not reach out to reviewers and approvers to request signatures directly. 

We cannot leave this stage until money is obligated, not just IAA signed.

### Who is involved in this stage?

- TTS: Acquisitions Team, Agreements Team, Finance Team
- NCR: OGC/Legal, Project Manager
- Partner agency: Legal, Project Team

### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage? 
1. Tasks done

	- Different forms as required by other agencies
3. Approvals needed

	- Client Finance point of contact
	- Client legal
	- Contracting Officer from client's acquisition team may need to be the signatory, or at least look at it. Ask your client.

### What can go wrong in this stage? 

This process can take an enormous amount of time if there is not a good process and working relationship between the project team, legal, finance, and the approving authorities at TTS, NCR, and the agency.

### What is the next step?

When IAA goes out for client signature, Acqstack Management creates a card for the project on the Acqstack Kanban Board under "IAA pending".

Once the IAA is signed, move into the Staffing phase.
