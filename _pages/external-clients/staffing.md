### What happens in this stage?
Substacks review projects in the "Staging" column of the 
[Acqstack Kanban Board](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KbMQvkggVjBvFpdTqrP4Qu3Rjekaavoh_9FRfAecI24/edit?pli=1#gid=0) during Daily Kanban Standups. They send the Executive Summary around to members of their substack. They decide whether to pull the project.

Once they pull a project, members of that substack are assigned and the [Project Onboarding Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AXDLCLU3Fzp5iCASmdOM8hPU2kU0eQhGE3RmHgEBEU0/edit) is completed.
