title: Solicitation Scoping
---

### How long does this process usually take?
Weeks to months.

### What happens in this stage? 
It's time to figure out what the client needs to buy, and the acquisition strategy to get it! Here, we may run workshops, do user research, and even do some prototyping. There is a coaching and consulting element to this stage as well, as we potentially teach them about the benefits of open source, agile developent, or modular contracting.

We learn as much as we can to develop an acquisition strategy and prepare to draft the acquisition documents.

For external buys, we only help our clients buy development work to build them a thing.

### Who is involved in this stage? 

- The client team
- The Acqstack team

### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage? 
1. Tasks done
	- Workshops or conversations to scope the need
	- Coaching to help client stakeholders buy in to new strategies (like agile, open source, or modular contracting) 
2. Documents created
	- Notes about solicitationÂ needs
3. Approvals needed
	- Preliminary client buy-off on acquisition strategy

### What can go wrong in this stage? 
Sometimes there is a desire to "just get started" and we just have a conversation with the client instead of a larger workshop. This is risky, and depending on the buy can definitely come back to bite you.

### What is the next step?
Infrastructure review
