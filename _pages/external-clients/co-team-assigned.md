title: NCR CO Team Assigned
---

### What happens in this stage? 
Once you have the required documents from the Drafting stage, the PM should contact the [NCR PM]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/ncr-pm) to set up a kickoff meeting. NCR will bring along a Contracting Officer and Contracting Specialist (CS).

During this kickoff, you will walk through the [Executive Summary]({{ site.baseurl }}/shared-data/executive-summary), explain the buy to NCR, and establish a mutually agreed upon timeline of events.

This is also a good time to agree on communication patterns (who from NCR is sending updates? Who is receiving them at TTS? How often are updates, and what types of events do you want to be updated about?) and workflow (doing all reviews and edits in Google Docs. If someone from NCR needs Google Docs training, let us know and we'll be happy to provide it.)

### How long does this process usually take?
A few days, if NCR is not at their WIP limit of active projects. 

### Who is involved in this stage? 
- NCR PM
- TTS project team
- Client project team
- NCR CO
- NCR CS

### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage? 
1. Tasks done
	- NCR assigns a CO and CS.
	- Kickoff meeting with NCR.
	- NCR commits to a timeline.
2. Documents created
	- N/A
3. Approvals needed
	- N/A

### What can go wrong in this stage? 
Sometimes this step is done just through email. This is pretty universally a bad plan, and almost guarantees problems down the road. A live conversation, either sit down or video call, is necessary to ensure all parties are on the same page about the acquisitiion strategy and timelines.

It's really important that NCR actually confirms their committment to the timeline. Put extra EXTRA emphasis on this near the end of the fiscal/calendar year.

### What is the next step?
Acquisition Package Review
