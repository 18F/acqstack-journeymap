title: Acquisition Package Review
---

### How long does this process usually take?
3-5 weeks. Sometimes longer.

### What happens in this stage? 
The NCR CO and CS review the solicitation documents the TTS project team put together. They may ask for changes, additional explanations, additional documents, or for certain sections to be rewritten. Everyone should be using Google Docs to review and make edits.

After changes are made, go back and get the client's approval. Then go back and get NCR's approval. 

This approval process is a cycle. Keep going until everyone is happy.

This process will take way longer than you expect it to, even for short and simple procurements. 

Be sure to work with the NCR CO to agree on a evaluation "consensus report" strategy for evaluation of bids with NCR CO. You want to ensure the NCR CO has no issues with the evaluation strategy.

### What can go wrong in this stage? 
There is a whole lot of going in circles getting approvals at this stage. Often, people farther from the project work (such as OGC) won't be properly read in on why we're taking a certain approach or doing things differently than the standard way. Be prepared for speedbumps, unexpected requests, or changes that don't seem to make sense given the acquisition strategy you've put together. 

### What is the next step?
Release the RFP.
