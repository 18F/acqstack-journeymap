title: Vendor Q&A
---

### What happens in this stage?
This phase is optional, depending on the type of solicitation. Often, you want to bake in time for questions and answers from vendors so they can prepare better proposals and more accurate price quotes. It's time to make it clear between the vendor and the client what is expected of them. It's also a chance for the vendor to point out inconsistencies in scope or objectives in different documents, and for us to correct those inconsistencies, and to clear up any technical concerns they have.

A direct award does not require this step, though they may still have questions.

Vendors post their questions as an issue on the Github repo. Configure this a Google Sheet with this script [FIND THE LINK TO THIS] that connects to your Github repo. It will copy issues from the repo into the Google Sheet. There TTS, the client, and NCR can collaborate on answers. The NCR CO will approve the answer, then TTS can post the answer as a response to the Github Issue. 

At the end of the Q&A period, the NCR CO will post all questions and answers as an amendment on eBuy, the system of record.

It is up to the CO’s discretion to allow questions after the Q&A has closed. Additional amendments should be posted for all vendors to see with answers to any further questions.

### How long does this process usually take?
There is no set-in-stone timelines, but for the Agile BPA we generally give vendors about 1 week to submit questions.

We spend a 2 or 3 days answering. Posting the answers (which traditionally happens by posting an amendment to the solicitation) can happen in 1 day.

### Who is involved in this stage? 
- NCR CO
- TTS team
- Client team
- Vendor points of contact

### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage? 
1. Tasks done
	- Questions recieved by TTS and client team
	- Answers are posted publicly 
2. Documents created
	- Amendment to the solicitation with questions and answers
3. Approvals needed
	- Some answers may need to be approved by legal, the CO, the client team, or the TTS team, depending on the subject matter.
	- The CO will likely want to approve answers to all questions before they are posted publicly. 

### What can go wrong in this stage? 
There can be more questions than expected, which can take a long time to answer. Questions can also reveal problems with the original solicitation that require more significant revisions. 

No matter how long you give vendors, history indicates they will typically wait until the last day possible to submit questions. Try posting in the Readme that you encourage vendors to ask questions early and often, and explain they'll get their answers faster.

If a vendor posts a question after the Q&A time is done and you choose to answer that question, you must re-open Q&A for everyone for some period of time. 

### What is the next step?
Proposals.
