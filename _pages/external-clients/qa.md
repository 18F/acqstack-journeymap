title: Vendor Q&A
---

This phase is optional, depending on the type of solicitation. Often, you want to bake in time for questions and answers from vendors so they can prepare better proposals and more accurate price quotes. A direct award would not require this step.

### How long does this process usually take?
There is no set-in-stone timelines, but for the Agile BPA we generally give vendors about 1 week to submit questions.

We spend a 2 or 3 days answering. Posting the answers (which traditionally happens by posting an amendment to the solicitation) can happen in 1 day.

### What happens in this stage?
Vendors post their questions as an issue on a Github repo. The government answers on Github. The CO will post all questions and answers as an amendment on eBuy, the system of record, when the Q&A period closes. 

It is up to the CO’s discretion to allow questions after the Q&A has closed. Additional amendments should be posted for all vendors to see with answers to any further questions.

### Who is involved in this stage? 
- NCR CO
- TTS team
- Client team
- Vendor points of contact

### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage? 
1. Tasks done
	- Questions recieved by TTS and client team
	- Answers are posted publicly 
2. Documents created
	- Amendment to the solicitation with questions and answers
3. Approvals needed
	- Some answers may need to be approved by legal, the CO, the client team, or the TTS team, depending on the subject matter.
	- The CO may want to approve answers to all questions before they are posted publicly. 

### What can go wrong in this stage? 
There can be more questions than expected, which can take a long time to answer. Questions can also reveal problems with the original solicitation that require more significant revisions. No matter how long you give vendors, history indicates they will typically wait until the last day possible to submit questions.

### What is the next step?
Proposals.
