title: Proposal Evaluation
---

### What happens in this stage? 
TTS and the client team forms an Technical Evaluation Panel or Board (TEP). This panel should be briefed by the TTS CO and NCR CO about how to properly do the evaluation and what to avoid doing to ensure compliance with all rules and regulations.

Evaluation panels are typically made up of a client product owner, a product lead, and a technical lead.

The evaluation panel will evaluate the written proposals, and then typically do oral interviews with vendors as well. Evaluate vendors on written proposals first so you have an idea of what you want to particularly listen to for that vendor during the orals. If you write it into the RFP, you can also disqualify a vendor based on their written proposal and skip their oral interview.

Scheduling these is much easier when you give the vendors windows of time to sign up for, rather than asking what works for them.

NCR handles formal communications with all bidders.

After evaluations are completed, NCR releases pricing information to TTS. Final determinations are then made.  

### How long does this process usually take?
1-3 weeks, depending on type of solicitation, number of bidders, and whether there are oral interviews.

### Who is involved in this stage? 
- NCR CO
- TTS/client eval team
- Vendor teams

### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage? 
1. Tasks done
	- All vendor bids must be evaluated, and decisions documented
	- A winning vendor is chosen
2. Documents created
	- Fill out oral evaluation ([template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iuHFhuSQHSPJ4hLeYLUhPPWTXAZRKxIEpy4pxOafHZc/edit))
	- (Depending on evaluation criteria) Consensus/summary document
	- (Depending on evaluation criteria) Strengths and weaknesses for each bid (if there was more than one proposal)
3. Approvals needed
	- Evaluation team
	- NCR CO

### What can go wrong in this stage? 
Timeline might go longer due to client-side issues. 

Scheduling oral interviews can be tough, and a vendor missing their oral interview can delay the whole timeline.

Written proposals take a long time to evaluate when there they don't follow a standard template.

Because price is introduced last, sometimes preferred vendor is out of price range. 

### What is the next step?
