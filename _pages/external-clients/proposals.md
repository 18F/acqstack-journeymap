title: Proposals
---

### What happens in this stage? 
Vendors submit their proposals to the NCR CO. The CO then sends us the proposals, sans the pricing information (so the evaluation team in the next phase can make an evaluation unbiased by price).

TTS is moving toward requiring vendors to comply with a specific proposal template. Making all proposals consistent would speed up evaluations and decrease the amount of content and overhead a vendor needs to create in order to bid.

### How long does this process usually take?
8-10 days after Q&A answers are submitted (if applicable)

### Who is involved in this stage? 
- Vendor POC
- NCR CO

### What needs to happen to get us out of this stage? 
1. Tasks done
	- Vendors needs to submit proposals to NCR CO
2. Documents created
	- Vendor proposals
3. Approvals needed
	- N/A

### What can go wrong in this stage? 
Vendor can submit proposals that are not compliant with a number of different requests. Some of these are insignificant, some of these violations might result in the NCR CO, or the TTS evaluation team disqualifying the proposal. 

We may not receive any bids.

They could send the pricing information directly to the TTS evaluation team, even though it's supposed to go to the NCR CO. The eval team is not supposed to see that information until after the first round of evaluations.

### What is the next step?
Evaluation.
